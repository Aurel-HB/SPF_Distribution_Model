# modelo_sardine

Our study aims to model seasonal and inter-annual variability in the distribution of dolphins' main prey, small pelagic fish, using a hierarchical model. The model integrates 3 types of data: presence-absence and biomass of fish from scientific campaigns and presence of fish from fishing data. The model applied to GoG sardines has provided, for the first time, a quantitative description of the seasonal spatial dynamics of this species and associated fisheries.
